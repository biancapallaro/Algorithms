Data points that fall many standard deviations from the mean - either above or below - might be worth investigating as bad data or from other suspicious angles (cheating schools, in this case).\n",

In this case, it was how third-grade scores relate to fourth-grade scores, and then how math and reading scores relate to one another. By using a regression, you can use one variable to predict what the other should be.\n",

    "Finally, we used the **residual** or **error** from the regression to see how far off each prediction was. Just like we did with the original scores, we used standard deviation to find usually suspiciously large errors. Even though yes, our regression might not be perfect, times when it's _very_ wrong probably call for an investigation."

    "* Standard deviation is how far away from the \"average\" a school is. Let's say you scored 3 standard deviations away from the average, but it was only a 5-point difference. What kind of situation could lead to that? Is it as important as being 3 standard deviations away but with a 50-point difference? \n",

    "* Did _we_ ignore those schools? If we did, how could we be more cautious in the future?\n",
    "* What are the pros and cons of selecting a cutoff like three standard deviations away from the predicted value? Note that [three standard deviations is a typical number in stats](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/311174/what-does-it-mean-when-three-standard-deviations-away-from-the-mean-i-land-ou)\n",
    "* What's the difference between a school with predicted scores -3 standard deviations away as compared to +3 standard deviations away? Do we need to pay attention to both, or only one?\n",
    "* What next steps should we take after we've calculated these findings?\n",
    "* If a school did have a strong math department and a weak english department, they would definitely be predicted incorrectly. What happens to that school after being flagged by research like this?"
